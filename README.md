This GitHub repository contains the Portfolio for the course 'Software Testing' at the University of Edinburgh. In this course, we were tasked with choosing a software/artefact and performing various software tests including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.

For this coursework, I managed to achieve 77% overall.

The project chosen was ILP (Informatics Large Practical), which was a year 3 project dealing with a drone pizza delivery service.
